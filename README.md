# Data Scientist Nanodegree
## Unsupervised Learning
### Project: Identify Customer Segments with Arvato

In this project, you will apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task. The project will consist of cleaning and processing data, applying dimensionality reduction techniques, and implementing clustering techniques to segment customers with the goal of reaching audiences that will have the highest rate of returns for a mail order company.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Code

Code is provided in the `Identify Customer Segments.ipynb` notebook file.

### Data

Data is provided by Arvato partners and Udacity, and is not allowed to be published due to restrictions of use. Data can only be used within the Udacity course. Identify Customer Segments data includes:

1) Demographic data for the general population of Germany
2) Demographic data for customers of a mail-order company
3) Data Dictionary with detailed information file about the features in the provided datasets.
4) A summary of feature attributes for demographics data
